# Portfolio Roadmap

This repository is the central hub for my public portfolio roadmap.  
It shows the planning, progress, and links to each demo application I’m building to showcase my skills in **Laravel**, **Vue/Nuxt**, **API design**, **performance optimization**, and **automation**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Demonstrate my ability to plan and execute projects step-by-step
- Showcase a range of concepts and technologies I work with
- Keep all portfolio progress in one public place for transparency

---

## 📅 How to follow my progress
You can view my full planning, milestones, and task progress here:  
**[📂 Public GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/projects/1)**

This project uses a **WIP limit of 1** – I only work on one demo at a time and finish it before starting the next.
